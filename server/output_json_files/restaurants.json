The tables are too close to each other.\n- the service was sub-par (brasserie level). They forgot to pour the wine before bringing the plates, I ordered an extra glass of wine which arrived 30' later, they were clearing the plates and cutlery from the left. Lots of personnel in the dining room but very poorly coordinated.\n- my main concern, the plates became less and less enjoyable as we advanced through the menu. The aged tuna tartare with capucine could have been excellent, save that its taste was drowned by too much yuzu/ponzu spice on top. The salad with seafood sauce should not be served in any starred restaurant - just by the look of it its place is maybe in a brasserie. The lobster with marjolaine was ok but uninspiring. The hay-cooked fish with porcini could have been excellent - both the fish and the porcini shavings were superb; however, the cooked porcini was completely tasteless. The guinea fowl was bland, and it came with two \"satellite dishes\" that did not fit at all with the main dish. Finally the red cabbage-based desert was \"interesting\" but not a great way to close the dinner.\n- while comprehensive, the wine list has very limited choice between EUR 100-300.

The hotel itself is nestled into this beautiful town, our room was indistinguishable from the landscape and cliff side into the beautiful harbor. It was incredibly private and so romantic! Every time we left and returned from our room, the front desk staff was so cheerful and thoughtful. They had excellent recommendations, they knew when we were leaving so cleaning staff could come in, and were so genuinely nice. I can\u2019t wait to come back to this place again.

Service was great as expected.\nThe swimming pool is nice, clean and classy with great service too.\nA major disappointment was the beach. The only good thing about it is the view of sea and hills in the background, otherwise the water is among the most unclean I have ever seen in the French Riviera. The water is full of leaves, candy wrappers, paper, other objects\u2026\nThere is a boat with huge nets trying to keep it clean but the water condition is surprisingly still not acceptable. The neighboring public beach offers a better swimming experience!!\n\nOn checkout, we asked for a late checkout but we were offered an extra hour only for one of the rooms despite our late check in\u2026\n\nFinally, the concierge desk was very helpful with advice and booking events.\nAll in all, a good stay if you want luxury dining and a nice pool experience but if you are looking for a good beach or a luxurious room then you may be disappointed.",

I don't know about that, but it is undoubtedly the coolest one. With a laid-back and relaxed atmosphere, waves gently rolling onto the pebbled beach one after another, it exudes tranquility and offers breathtaking views of the coastline. After soothing our tired minds with the sounds of the sea and enjoying an #apero, it was time to peruse the menu. Instantly, I knew we had come to the right place. Barrette Rouge opted for the mouthwatering #LobsterLinguine, while the mysterious mademoiselle behind the scenes chose the delicate Pink #Shrimp Bouquet. Both dishes were simply delicious. This is one of those restaurants that you will not forget and will want to visit over and over again whenever you get the chance.\n\nDon't give up if you can't find the entrance to the tunnel; ask the locals, and they will gladly guide you.",

I could give the place 6 stars if I could. It\u2019s beautiful and is a great place to get together for drinking or just having that date with special someone.\nThe food was ok to me. I got the modern California rolls which I thought was good. The shrimp with red Thai spicy curry was a but salty to me because it wasn\u2019t served with rice, and drank the curry soup and it was salty. The shrimp would have been a little better if it wasn\u2019t too breaking a part too much. Other than that, the taste was good, just a bit on the saly side.\nGot the Wok fried beef with Thai basil, along with some sesame noodles. Ok, noodles were cooked right, soft and not starchy, but my beef was just wayyyy to salty in my opinion. Dont get me wrong, the taste is good, if only the chef went easy on the salt then it would be perfect. Im a person that eats really salty food, my food has to be flavorful, and I can drink fish sauce.. but if I can\u2019t even try to finish, then it was not made for my palate. Service was excellent. Food came out all together at once very quickly per our request. Music was played just right, not too loud. Overall, nice experience. I would come back again to try the rest of the menus.",

The appetizers were excellent as well, especially the fresh fish carpaccio marinated in olive oil and lemon juice.\n\nAfter dinner, I was able to enjoy myself in the club area of SASS Cafe. The music was great, and the atmosphere was electrifying. The cocktails were excellent, especially the signature drinks created specifically for SASS Cafe.\n\nOverall, my visit to SASS Cafe was an unforgettable experience.
