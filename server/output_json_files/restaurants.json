This outlet is quite big and the book collections are amazing as well. They even have some Manga volumes and box sets, which were completely random though.\n\nComing to the food, no complaints tbh. Absolutely delicious. Veg and Non veg varieties were amazing, from continental to Indian.\n\nService, however, could have been better. It is understandable to an extent that when the cafe is houseful there could be delays in attending each and every customer. But it could have been better, it surely can't take 25 mins for a mocha to be served. The staff sometimes just forget the orders and we have to remind them, which is a letdown since they seem to provide great hospitality at the start.\n\nI would suggest this place anyday, the prices are affordable, great location, enough parking spaces, and amazing book collection.",

So, this is the kind of restaurant you take your foreign friend/client to -- exotic, authentic, and pleasant.\n\nWe had the following.\n1. Navaratna dosai -- A normal ghee (clarified butter) dosai with dry fruits -- such as almond (badam), tooty-frooty, apple, pineapple, cashew, cherry -- inside the fold of the dosai.\nThis was sweet and the `ghee'ness was super!\nThe accompanying sambar and onion chutney were spicy to the right levels, the coconut-bengal gram chutney was very soft.\nI ate two cups of each of the three.\n\n2. Roti and pudhina paratha -- were normal.\n3. Methi Malai mutter and Paneer pasanda -- the gravies were soft (less spicy) and flavourful.\nWe actually ordered the 'Methi makkai palak', but we were served (and billed) Methi malai mutter.\n\n4. On the house vadaam (sort of a rice flour dough deep fry) at the beginning and sweet beeda (beetel leaf folded with sweet stuffing inside) were given.\nI was never a fan or regular eater of beeda, but I tried it that day. It was nice and juicy, the sweetness and leafness were well balanced.\n\n5. The servers bring around 4 pickles now and then. I tried the puli inji (tamarind and ginger), and mango ginger.  Both were very good.\n\nThe prices are very high ~Rs. 1600 for two, but the quality of food , ambience, and service were very good.",

This affordability factor becomes even more apparent when compared to other cafes, making it a standout choice for those conscious of their budget.\n\nIn essence, this place has mastered the art of creating a harmonious fusion of delectable cuisine, inviting atmosphere, attentive service, and reasonable pricing.

Without a doubt, this establishment has secured its place as a memorable and cherished dining destination for us, leaving us eager for the next opportunity to indulge in its culinary offerings.",
