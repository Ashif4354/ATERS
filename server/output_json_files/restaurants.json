Location is good in a way that there is no city noise, and being higher up.. the weather is better than city and air is fresh. Would come back again, no hesitation in recommending.",

The room provided for elderly people requires climbing stairs, causing severe discomfort for those with knee pain.\n2. Most staff speak only English and Hindi, making it challenging for Tamil-speaking individuals to communicate.\n3. Room toilets were poorly maintained, with broken seat covers and bad odor. Despite raising the issue, no action was taken until I had to shout.\n4. The extra mattress provided was essentially a sofa, a poor choice for a 4-star hotel.\n5. They charged approximately 20k for 6 adults on New Year's night, with organizers exclusively using Hindi and English, ignoring complaints from Tamil speakers.\n6. Despite being a 4-star hotel, they had only one lift, and it was under maintenance during part of our stay. Staff and the manager were unhelpful, causing significant struggles for our elderly family members.\n7. Room service and dine-in were frustrating as staff only spoke English and Hindi, often ignoring requests.\n8. The hotel arranged a live kitchen in front of rooms without exhaust, causing more discomfort than the toilet odor.\n9. The New Year party next to our rooms led to an entire night of frustration. We considered vacating the room at midnight due to our elderly parents.\n10. When raising concerns about English and Hindi-speaking staff to the manager, he suggested that Hindi is our national language, refusing further discussion.\n11. I booked a studio photoshoot, but it was later informed to be on B2 level, accessible only via stairs or the non-functional lift.\n12. Requesting a campfire, I was misinformed about its location, and the manager suggested going to B2 level via stairs due to the non-functional lift.\n13. The hotel lacks a \"DO NOT DISTURB\" sign, resulting in room service knocking even when guests are sleeping.\n14. Room service changed blankets but left the old ones in the room, requiring an additional call for cleanup.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAvoid this hotel if:\n- You have elderly family members who cannot climb stairs.\n- You cannot speak Hindi.\n- You can't tolerate bad odors from poorly maintained toilets.\n- You're unwilling to tolerate poor responses from the manager.\n- You want to avoid a disastrous vacation experience.",

Someone scratched my car when it was parked, but the security person doesn't even know how it happened.\n\nIt's of worth only if you get some deal around 3k to 3.5k for a premium Lake view room.
