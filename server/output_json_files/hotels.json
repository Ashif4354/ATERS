Location is good in a way that there is no city noise, and being higher up.. the weather is better than city and air is fresh. Would come back again, no hesitation in recommending.",

First star goes for there service , staff was really amazing and very helpful, receptionist suresh was very kind. May it is room service or service in the restaurant, they have excellent staff who are very nice people.\n\n2.second star goes for there rooms , very well designed cottages. Very clean , they have a smart TV which is a plus . The view was also really good.\n\n3. Third star goes to the taste of food which I really liked , although they can definitely improve on the menu. Taste wise they have done a good job.\n\nNow the reason for cutting down the two stars\u2026(please note before you book)\n\n1. Do not book this location if you want to use the SPA and want to have a staycation setup , although there website says Ayatana resort & Spa , this place does not have a spa and you will be disappointed if you are planning a staycation\n2. Yes they have a fireplace inside your room or they do arrange private bon fire behind your room(balcony) , but they charge a whooping 1500/-rs plus tax for it and the wood logs they get doesn\u2019t last for more than 20 mins , this has to change. The room charges are expensive and this extra charge for a bon fire of 30 mins is a disappointment again.\n3. If you have bought dinner buffet , please note that you will not be allowed to carry your food to your room. Let\u2019s say you have a group of friends who plan to party late and eat late after a drink , well there restaurant closes at 10:30pm , dinner won\u2019t be served after that and yes if you plan to serve your food to a plate and take it to your room and have it later , well it\u2019s not allowed (not sure why they have this , while the big guns like taj or hyatt allow this )\n4. Yes, this place has a very serene vibe however this place is bit far from Ooty. And DO NOT , DO NOT step out during the night trusting google maps because the map does not recognise the right route and you will be lost. The place is very remote and you will be lost in a remote area. Absolutely doesn\u2019t feel safe. The resort does not have any signboards to guide you , not sure why a resort of a such big chain does not have sign boards or advertisement boards to guide and show the remaining distance.\n5. No much activities if you are planning a staycation, resorts or home stays around the same area are offering a lot of activities. This resort only has archery and a rope activity for kids nothing else to do\n6. Taking of one star for the room as a heater is definitely recommended, the rooms get freezing cold because of the granite and the sheet roofing. So a heater is needed",

This place is not safe fof family.\n2. Rooms: As this is a hostel there is no privacy. All rooms are at ground floor hence you can not open curtains. I booked most expensive heritage room but all money wasted. Reception counter is placed at room entry door. You can listen what going on outside and  others can listen whats going on inside.\n3.Amenities: You will get nothing. Even they wont provide toiletries. There is no AC /heater and basic amenities like water jar/kettle in the room.\n4.  Food : Very poor quality food. There is no restaurant/ seating place to eat food. We ordered chicken but we took only one bite. O think it was not chiken, it was something else. They will not provide water even if you ready to pay.\n5. Service : Pathetic service. Whatever you ask staff will say no. We requested room heater or bonfire due to very low temperature. But they didn't provide. There is nothing they can service.

Surprisingly, for curd rice too. Buffet breakfast is included for few, but the same menu everyday, you need to wait again 30 mins if the item is completed, for them to refill it. Someone scratched my car when it was parked, but the security person doesn't even know how it happened.\n\nIt's of worth only if you get some deal around 3k to 3.5k for a premium Lake view room. Else it's totally waste. Better to go for some premium resorts or hotels , atleast to get some professional service.\n\nTotally, average stay experience here",

You have to call the staff Atleast twice to tell them things like give new towels, soaps, and etc. After you call them they are going to take their own time to give u the stuff you actually want 30 - 45 minutes and if its at 11pm they will just forget to give you the things u wanted. The rooms are terrible and filled with insects and the walls are stained as well as beds and blankets stained. The mattress and blankets provided are Degrade, all are stinking and are wet, and the TVs are 2nd handed the setup box doesn't contain the channels of our favor.
