The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly the exquisite food offered at the hotel. Every meal was a culinary delight, with a diverse range of dishes that catered to various tastes. From traditional Punjabi cuisine to international delicacies, the hotel's restaurant truly exceeded our expectations.\n\nWhat made our stay even more enjoyable was the exceptional service provided by the hotel staff, particularly Jasmine. She went above and beyond to ensure that we had a comfortable and memorable stay. Her warm hospitality and willingness to assist with any request truly stood out. Jasmine's attention to detail and dedication to making our stay special left a lasting impression on us.\n\nThe hotel itself was a haven of luxury and elegance, with well-appointed rooms, stunning decor, and impeccable cleanliness. The attention to detail in every aspect of the hotel's design and maintenance was evident throughout our stay.\n\nIn summary, our experience at the Taj Hotel was nothing short of extraordinary. The combination of outstanding food, a luxurious environment, and the exceptional service of staff like Jasmine made our stay truly remarkable. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area, and I look forward to returning in the future.\n\nReview from my Dad (Yadwinder Singh)",

The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly the exquisite food offered at the hotel. Every meal was a culinary delight, with a diverse range of dishes that catered to various tastes. From traditional Punjabi cuisine to international delicacies, the hotel's restaurant truly exceeded our expectations.\n\nWhat made our stay even more enjoyable was the exceptional service provided by the hotel staff, particularly Jasmine. She went above and beyond to ensure that we had a comfortable and memorable stay. Her warm hospitality and willingness to assist with any request truly stood out. Jasmine's attention to detail and dedication to making our stay special left a lasting impression on us.\n\nThe hotel itself was a haven of luxury and elegance, with well-appointed rooms, stunning decor, and impeccable cleanliness. The attention to detail in every aspect of the hotel's design and maintenance was evident throughout our stay.\n\nIn summary, our experience at the Taj Hotel was nothing short of extraordinary. The combination of outstanding food, a luxurious environment, and the exceptional service of staff like Jasmine made our stay truly remarkable. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area, and I look forward to returning in the future.\n\nReview from my Dad (Yadwinder Singh)",

                        "text": "This was one of the worst hotels stays I have had. First of all, this is NOT a 5 star hotel. Maybe it once was but it cannot claim to be one anymore. I don't know of any 5 star hotels that don't have running hot water. I had to call someone from reception when I needed hot water for a bath and someone brought hot water in a bucket with a mug!! There was a musty moldy unpleasant smell throughout the hotel. The first room I got had such a strong smell of mold and the bathrooms smelled of sewage so I asked for a room change. The rooms are super old and in need of an update. Nearly all the pieces of furniture are scuffed, chipped and damaged. My bed linen was stained as was the chair in the room. Cleanliness is not at all a priority at the park. There was dirt and grime on the corners of the room, the windows had not been cleaned in ages and the carpets in the halls were littered with matchsticks and little pieces of trash. There were towels soaking up water on the floor in some places in the hallway. The worst part was that I got very sick from the food after ordering room service in the night. I was up throwing up all night because of it.  The chef and staff very apologetic about this later which I appreciate.  The breakfast spread was also decent. Everything is super over priced though including the food, the shuttle service(Rs. 2200 for airport v/s Rs.360 on OLA) and the room itself. It is worth less than half that in my opinion. My understanding is that the only reason this place continues to operate is because of its proximity to the US consulate.  It is a short walk away and was super convenient. However, the convenience was not worth the hit in comfort of stay and I will never be staying in this hotel again even if I have work at the consulate. Save your money and stay some place else and invest the money in cab fare.",

They did not allow us to take any group photo except in the private dining area, where there were sharp focus lights so the photos came out very bad.\nThe best part was that after telling us not to take any photos, we found their own staff, that too on duty, taking photos of themselves in the same lobby! One rule for the guests and another for the staff? Very weird.\nParking was another issue. They do not have a basement parking and insist on valet.

One of my friends gave his new Mercedes to the valet, and when we got the car back, there was a  long time across two doors, which the hotel team kept insisting was already there before we gave for the valet.\nCCTV footage showed that the scratch was not there at the time of giving to the valet for parking, but still the hotel was not ready to accept the point.\nFinally we had no choice but to leave.\nThe good food and the ambiance and our nice mood was spoilt by the attitude of the staff all around",
