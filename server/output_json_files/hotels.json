I don't know of any 5 star hotels that don't have running hot water. I had to call someone from reception when I needed hot water for a bath and someone brought hot water in a bucket with a mug!! There was a musty moldy unpleasant smell throughout the hotel. The first room I got had such a strong smell of mold and the bathrooms smelled of sewage so I asked for a room change. The rooms are super old and in need of an update. Nearly all the pieces of furniture are scuffed, chipped and damaged. My bed linen was stained as was the chair in the room. Cleanliness is not at all a priority at the park. There was dirt and grime on the corners of the room, the windows had not been cleaned in ages and the carpets in the halls were littered with matchsticks and little pieces of trash. There were towels soaking up water on the floor in some places in the hallway. The worst part was that I got very sick from the food after ordering room service in the night. I was up throwing up all night because of it.  The chef and staff very apologetic about this later which I appreciate.  The breakfast spread was also decent. Everything is super over priced though including the food, the shuttle service(Rs. 2200 for airport v/s Rs.360 on OLA) and the room itself. It is worth less than half that in my opinion. My understanding is that the only reason this place continues to operate is because of its proximity to the US consulate.  It is a short walk away and was super convenient. However, the convenience was not worth the hit in comfort of stay and I will never be staying in this hotel again even if I have work at the consulate. Save your money and stay some place else and invest the money in cab fare.",

The executive who had advised us of the early check-in was no where to be seen.  They can do better on improving their internal and external communications. I wish they'd keep their word and offer a better customer experience. Since we had some time to kill, we observed that the lobby/reception area was rather dull and gloomy.  We discovered that our room's door lock got jammed in the middle of night though they attended to it, they removed the lock completely, it was ok with us as we were 2 gents, it could be problematic if there were female guests.

From the moment I stepped into the lobby to the time of my departure, every aspect of my experience surpassed my expectations.

The efficiency and professionalism displayed by the check-in desk staff were commendable. Please convey my heartfelt appreciation to them for their seamless service.\n\nNow, let's talk about the culinary delights that awaited me. The food at Ramada was nothing short of fabulous and sumptuous. I had the pleasure of indulging in their buffet breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and each meal was a gastronomic delight. The variety and quality of dishes surpassed my expectations. What's more, the service staff were warm, attentive, and always ready to assist. Their proactive approach ensured that I never had to wait long for any additional specialties or made-to-order dishes. Please extend my gratitude to the service staff for their exceptional hospitality.\n\nThe accommodation provided was equally impressive. The rooms were immaculate, well-maintained, and exuded a sense of calm and relaxation, which was much needed after braving the heat of Chennai. The housekeeping team deserves special mention for their meticulous attention to detail. They not only kept the rooms spotless but also took special care to replenish any items that were running low. Please convey my appreciation to the housekeeping staff for their dedication to ensuring a comfortable stay.\nOverall, my stay at Ramada Hotel in Chennai was nothing short of extraordinary. The impeccable service, delectable food, and serene ambiance surpassed all my expectations.

I phoned reception and they responded without any apology, simply with a 'we'll send some up'.\n\nUpon further inspection of the room it was clear that the room had not been cleaned at all since the previous guest. The carpet had food crumbs, hairs and other litter. There was more litter on the table and stains throughout the room and no shower gel or towels.\n\nI went downstairs to inform reception that they had checked us into an uncleaned room.

We finally received towels after 11 at night but no cleaning happened and we had to sleep in a dirty room.\n\nI have never had such an appalling experience in any hotel, of any rating. When checking out the next morning I asked for the duty manager and the lady at reception said it was she. I explained everything and complained and all she said was 'We will ensure it doesn't happen to the next guest'. Appalled at this inadequate response I asked to speak with another manager.\n\nThe next manager took things a little more seriously and had an excuse that many people had checked out that day. He then comped us our small bar bill.\n\nIt's inconceivable to me that a hotel of this reputation would not be ready to check in guest so late in the evening. It is also astonishing that the hotel would check guests into a dirty room. It is unacceptable that having brought this to the attention of reception nothing was done about it.
