Mattress are comfortable.\nFood is phenomenal in all areas.\nCoffee is very poor: 10 euros for cheap, over roasted espresso from automatic chimbally machine\u2026 20 euros for iced coffee :) For management: hire coffee consultant and level up your coffee game with specialty beans. Then you have the right to charge higher price.\nCleaning stuff on the floor (#4) is super pleasant, efficient and friendly.\nThe location of the hotel is great. There are few great restaurants on the beach, 7min walking distance. I will recommend this hotel if you don\u2019t care about the disgusting smoke of cigarettes.",

The counter staff were friendly and courteous. They helped us find interesting things to see as we were only staying for two nights. (Highly recommend getting on the \"Hop on and Hop off bus\" to get a quick tour of the city and wind up at the royal castle and grounds!) The workout facility was excellent. And then there was breakfast - WONDERFUL, with loads of variety! Great staff and bar staff in the restaurant as well. Even the maid service was friendly and a pleasure to speak to. Unfortunately, we stayed in the off season so we could not enjoy that lovely pool. We did get to view and take pictures of the garden and outdoor lounge and bar area which I am sure would be a lot of fun to hang around and wind down at.",

The counter staff were friendly and courteous. They helped us find interesting things to see as we were only staying for two nights. (Highly recommend getting on the \"Hop on and Hop off bus\" to get a quick tour of the city and wind up at the royal castle and grounds!) The workout facility was excellent. And then there was breakfast - WONDERFUL, with loads of variety! Great staff and bar staff in the restaurant as well. Even the maid service was friendly and a pleasure to speak to. Unfortunately, we stayed in the off season so we could not enjoy that lovely pool. We did get to view and take pictures of the garden and outdoor lounge and bar area which I am sure would be a lot of fun to hang around and wind down at.",

The bathroom was beautiful, clean, and well-appointed. The lovely patio was a wonderful place to relax on chaise lounges. The location is perfect as we were steps away from the famous Monte Carlo casino, tons of shopping and eating options, and the beautiful marina with all of the yachts. I used the spa, which was quite busy but beautiful and modern. We also ate at the Michelin-starred restaurant Pavyllon and had one of the best meals we have had in recent years with perhaps the best views we have ever had at a restaurant. I highly recommend the hotel!",

It is disappointing that the room service menu is very poor and not updated to reflect what is actually available and especially what is available from 10pm, which is more like what you get in a 3 star hotel. This is in stark contrast to what they offer in the restaurants at the same time ( one of them has 2 Michelin Stars). The larger expensive suites are probably not occupied a lot as there is a stale water smell in the bathroom. The one you get when pipes are not run enough. When I asked to speak to a manager I was told here was nobody available and they had gone home...I had to email the CEO and even then nothing was resolved I was just told he would talk to me in the morning (when I will have likely left) . I would say a perfect dreamy place to stay in a normal room or basic suite so long as you don't expect too much food veriety on the room service menu and enjoy the restaurants instead. The mini bar is lacking in typical drinks and snacks you would expect in a top end 5 star hotel and they should leave more water in the suite each day. The massage treatments we had were great although we had to walk through a busy restaurant to go to and from the treatment rooms which is not ideal. I will day the room service server was very quick and attentive (albeit not empowered to offer anything outside the incorrect menu) but very good guy all the same. The front desk and bell boys gave quick and friendly service. In summary. they need to fix the small details to be able to justify the very expensive cost of the larger suites and compete with other properties near by. The location, staff and other amenities go a long way to making up for some of the defects though.",

The room was very clean and well stocked with towels, toilet paper, etc. The bed had fluffy pillows, a comfortable duvet, and perfect mattress. We loved the pool so much we spent every day there.

The hotel itself is nestled into this beautiful town, our room was indistinguishable from the landscape and cliff side into the beautiful harbor. It was incredibly private and so romantic! Every time we left and returned from our room, the front desk staff was so cheerful and thoughtful. They had excellent recommendations, they knew when we were leaving so cleaning staff could come in, and were so genuinely nice. I can\u2019t wait to come back to this place again.

Everything about the hotel all the way down to how its run and its location was perfect! The staff were very friendly on arrival (didn't get the receptionists name at the time) and checked us in promptly. The rooms were very spacious and clean with clear instructions on how to operate the facilities throughout.\n\nWe stayed in room 107 which is a 6 person room and we couldn't of asked for anything better! Plenty of spacious beds that were extremely comfortable, a comfortable sofa bed and much more available throughout the apartment.\n\nThe location of the hotel was extremely convenient for us and anyone here to visit Monaco. its a 10-15 min walk to the harbor of Monaco but be warned, the climb back up can be very steep! There are luckily elevators that take you up street levels if stairs are a problem for you.\n\nThis hotel is a 10/10 on every scale, really enjoyed our stay and we will 100% be returning if we are ever in the area!",

The reception clearly said there would be no charges if I informed them 4 days in advance and so I informed then 7 days in advance. But when I actually got my invoice, they had increased the room rate significantly for the last week and the refund I received was only 430 EUR where I expected 7 days rate refund coming to around 1200 EUR (166 EUR * 7 nights). My colleagues who did the same process received a refund of 700+ euros and 1200 + euros respectively since they booked through agencies who were able to negotiate better refunds. I had booked online. So for my booking was more profitable for the hotel since they paid no commissions, but I was not given the refund promised. I have upcoming stays in Monaco in October and I have chosen a different hotel for all this stay due to this experience. My company is also unhappy that I ended up paying more than my daily eligibility without their approvals.",

I have never seen a place more filthy than this. Authorities should close it down and force the owners of this hotel to clean and renovate it because it is a health hazard!!! The room curtains are dirty, as well as the bed-skirt which has visible traces of black oily dirt accumulated in years and years of not being cleaned!!! The windows are not soundproofed so you can hear all the noises from the street, like heavy traffic and lots of motorcycles passing by day and night. The bed is very low and with an uncomfortable sponge mattress that gives you back pain. The hotel has a bad vinegar smell, it's something I've never experienced anywhere before.\nThe air vents for heating are not cleaned, you can see the dust inside and are very noisy. The toilet was broken and nobody came to fix it. The manager and the employees (all Italians) they simply mock the clients! They make comments in Italian behind the customer's back - it happened to me when I went to tell them about the dirty room. \"If she doesn't like it, she should go to a 5* hotel\" was one comment made by the manager, an Italian woman, as was right in front of them. A guy at the reception, Mario I think, told me that the rooms were clean, and \"it's just like at home\" , meaning the mould in the bathroom!\nAll the positive reviews for this hotel are fake, paid for, so be very careful because you will have a very unpleasant surprise when you get there. Please notice the response from the hotel to our posts, it promises to take care of the issues, but it NEVER does! Someone should call the French authorities to inspect and close down this place because it is a health hazard!",

It is the most abysmal disgusting putrid vomit inducing stench I\u2019ve ever had to endure. Yet again I\u2019m sleeping with the windows open, getting eaten alive by mosquitoes, just in the hope that the smell will dissipate slightly.\n\nI\u2019m so so tired and disgusted. SORT IT OUT.",
