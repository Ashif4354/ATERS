My entire room was vibrating from the loud music blasted from the club.\n\nThe event was scheduled to stop at 4am.\nThe first night it ended at 4am, the second night music was still blasting at 4:30am.  When I called to speak with concierge to make a noise complaint, I was told the music was off.  Clearly it was not because my room was still vibrating and I would have never called in the first place. The receptionist told me she would look into it. I called back at 4:40am because the music was still on, and asked to speak with the manager. The manager yet again told me the music was off when it wasn\u2019t.  I went downstairs to speak to the manager directly because clearly my concerns were not being addressed. Both times they lied and told me the music was off and tried to gaslight me. Both the receptionist and manager refused to do anything until I said I\u2019m not leaving here until the music is off as the music was supposed to stop at 4am. I get that it\u2019s New Years Eve and people want to party. But this was almost 5am.\n\nWe are paying to stay at a 5 star hotel, not a club. You should implement a strict end time as most other countries do. Or if you want to play music all night long, then you should consider investing in some soundproof walls.\n\nThe way the situation was handled was soo unprofessional and I expect way better from a 5 star hotel.\n\nBesides that huge downfall, the rooms were spacious and clean. Large breakfast spread. Gym equipment were new and functional.",

I would recommend you get the hotel to organize your transfer from the airport -- their Innova is clean and the drivers are so helpful. We stayed at the Taj Newtown for a total of 6 nights. We loved it!\n\nEvery single member of staff is helpful, respectful and friendly, and speaks fluent English. The hotel is super clean, the rooms are huge, the beds are very comfortable, the bathrooms are spacious and hygienic. Everything you could want is available -- even your own iron and ironing board in your room. There is a lovely outdoor pool and a great gym -- both of which my kids found were perfect.\n\nThe buffet breakfast and dinner were AMAZING, so much variety, so many delicious dishes, also you can order extras like pizza and barbecued sizzlers and all kinds of roti. The cakes and deserts are unbelievable! We met the Sous Chef, Bhubaneswar Chatterjee to thank him for the gorgeous patisserie -- he had trained abroad in some grand restaurants which  explained the high standard. The restaurant is beautifully and efficiently run. We also met with Sujit Dey, a head chef, who was kind enough to make some special Bengali dishes for my children, and he discussed his recipes and gave me some great cooking tips. He was also kind enough to provide a packed lunch for us on the day we checked out because we had a long wait for our flight back to the UK. Really, the care and friendliness of the staff made us feel so special and welcome.\n\nThe surrounding area of Newtown is very impressive, a real regeneration project for Kolkata. There is a wonderful luxury Indian sweets centre opposite the hotel, a modern shopping mall right next door, and a Westside clothing department store (second floor for lovely Indian styles) within walking distance. Newtown is a bit far from the centre of the city, but we will definitely stay at this Taj again!",
