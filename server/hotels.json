There are only 4-5 experience staff members and remaining are college students. Food was worst, they serve cold food. They don't care about guests. In my room, washroom shower was broken, they don't do proper quality check before any guest check-in to the room. Room service was worst, they even don't drop your luggage inside to your room, they dropped my luggage at the room's door itself. They don't provide any invoice also, at the time of checkout , they advised that I will receive invoice copy over the email, now 15 days completed but there is no email invoice. I will recommend that stay away from this so called luxury resort. I am very disappointed from their services, I never expect this type of service from Sterling group of Hotels staff.",

The room provided for elderly people requires climbing stairs, causing severe discomfort for those with knee pain.\n2. Most staff speak only English and Hindi, making it challenging for Tamil-speaking individuals to communicate.\n3. Room toilets were poorly maintained, with broken seat covers and bad odor. Despite raising the issue, no action was taken until I had to shout.\n4. The extra mattress provided was essentially a sofa, a poor choice for a 4-star hotel.\n5. They charged approximately 20k for 6 adults on New Year's night, with organizers exclusively using Hindi and English, ignoring complaints from Tamil speakers.\n6. Despite being a 4-star hotel, they had only one lift, and it was under maintenance during part of our stay. Staff and the manager were unhelpful, causing significant struggles for our elderly family members.\n7. Room service and dine-in were frustrating as staff only spoke English and Hindi, often ignoring requests.\n8. The hotel arranged a live kitchen in front of rooms without exhaust, causing more discomfort than the toilet odor.\n9. The New Year party next to our rooms led to an entire night of frustration. We considered vacating the room at midnight due to our elderly parents.\n10. When raising concerns about English and Hindi-speaking staff to the manager, he suggested that Hindi is our national language, refusing further discussion.\n11. I booked a studio photoshoot, but it was later informed to be on B2 level, accessible only via stairs or the non-functional lift.\n12. Requesting a campfire, I was misinformed about its location, and the manager suggested going to B2 level via stairs due to the non-functional lift.\n13. The hotel lacks a \"DO NOT DISTURB\" sign, resulting in room service knocking even when guests are sleeping.\n14. Room service changed blankets but left the old ones in the room, requiring an additional call for cleanup.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAvoid this hotel if:\n- You have elderly family members who cannot climb stairs.\n- You cannot speak Hindi.\n- You can't tolerate bad odors from poorly maintained toilets.\n- You're unwilling to tolerate poor responses from the manager.\n- You want to avoid a disastrous vacation experience.",

Earl's Secret is a cozy, beautiful place surrounded by beautiful flowers, welcoming staff and delicious but pricey food. When we came in before 6pm and the sun was still out, I loved the greenery and the vast amount of flowers and the looks and feels of the rooms from the outside. Beautiful place I shall say. Come dinner time, for starters we had the chilli chicken and it was ok for me. Am not too much of a fan of spicy food but it was ok. For the main dish, we ordered butter naan and Dhaba chicken. It was yum but I think a bit too expensive. Although they did mention though that they use high quality ingredients. The staff were great, especially Pinki and one other guy I didn't get the name of. They were really attentive of our needs and were really nice. Kudos to the team for a job well done and compliments to the chef!",

Below is my feedback\nPROS:\nGood locality to stay in. Very peaceful surroundings. Perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. Very scenic location\nThere is a KSTDC Horticulture garden with ample space right next to the hotel, which is free for hotel guests.\nGood and clean rooms which is quite spacious for a family of 3.\nHot water available for 24hrs.\nAttached Restaurant with good breakfast options. Breakfast is also quite good.\nA small indoor gaming area with the following games for some light fun activity\n- Carrom\n- Chess\n- Ludo/Snake and Ladders\n- A couple of badminton rackets\nFood can be ordered to your Hotel rooms{only snacks though}\nStaff was very good.\nMassage service was also available in case anyone is interested. I found the rates quite reasonable.\nCONS:\nChinese food at the restaurant needs significant improvement. I would not recommend ordering any kind of Chinese food from this hotel's restaurant.\nIf you forget to carry any basic items then you would probably need to travel to the city center to get it. This could be a problem in case you do not have your own personal transport.\nService at the restaurant can get a bit slow at times especially when there are a lot of customers.\nMany items from the menu were unavailable. Considering it was peak season and Hotel was completely booked, they should have taken care of this.\n\nNOTE:- If you are traveling with a driver he will have to probably sleep in the vehicle as no separate accommodation is provided for him. However other things such as blankets, pillows etc.. and access to bathrooms will be provided.",

                        "text": "We stayed in this Hotel in May-2023. Our stay at Hotel Mayura Sudarshan was quite good and met all our expectations. Below is my feedback\nPROS:\nGood locality to stay in. Very peaceful surroundings. Perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. Very scenic location\nThere is a KSTDC Horticulture garden with ample space right next to the hotel, which is free for hotel guests.\nGood and clean rooms which is quite spacious for a family of 3.\nHot water available for 24hrs.\nAttached Restaurant with good breakfast options. Breakfast is also quite good.\nA small indoor gaming area with the following games for some light fun activity\n- Carrom\n- Chess\n- Ludo/Snake and Ladders\n- A couple of badminton rackets\nFood can be ordered to your Hotel rooms{only snacks though}\nStaff was very good.\nMassage service was also available in case anyone is interested. I found the rates quite reasonable.\nCONS:\nChinese food at the restaurant needs significant improvement. I would not recommend ordering any kind of Chinese food from this hotel's restaurant.\nIf you forget to carry any basic items then you would probably need to travel to the city center to get it. This could be a problem in case you do not have your own personal transport.\nService at the restaurant can get a bit slow at times especially when there are a lot of customers.\nMany items from the menu were unavailable. Considering it was peak season and Hotel was completely booked, they should have taken care of this.\n\nNOTE:- If you are traveling with a driver he will have to probably sleep in the vehicle as no separate accommodation is provided for him. However other things such as blankets, pillows etc.. and access to bathrooms will be provided.",

The room was a letdown, seriously lacking basic stuff and not well taken care of.\n\nThe tiny toilets were just uncomfortable, and the noise in the hotel made sleeping impossible. Even though the hotel is close to Ooty Lake, the problems we faced overshadowed any good.\n\nThe worst part? The service was terrible. Caught the staff doing things they shouldn't, like drinking alcohol. It was unprofessional and totally disappointing.\n\nAnd guess what? They promised amenities, but no free breakfast, no Wi-Fi \u2013 it was a letdown. The whole experience was way below what we paid for.\n\nEating there? Don't even get me started. The promised stuff just didn't happen. I've got complaints and concerns, and I hope the management fixes things up real quick. They need to step up with better staff, room quality, and overall service.",

The room was a letdown, seriously lacking basic stuff and not well taken care of.\n\nThe tiny toilets were just uncomfortable, and the noise in the hotel made sleeping impossible. Even though the hotel is close to Ooty Lake, the problems we faced overshadowed any good.\n\nThe worst part? The service was terrible. Caught the staff doing things they shouldn't, like drinking alcohol. It was unprofessional and totally disappointing.\n\nAnd guess what? They promised amenities, but no free breakfast, no Wi-Fi \u2013 it was a letdown. The whole experience was way below what we paid for.\n\nEating there? Don't even get me started. The promised stuff just didn't happen. I've got complaints and concerns, and I hope the management fixes things up real quick. They need to step up with better staff, room quality, and overall service.",

Very well lit naturally. Clean and neat all around . Waiters wearing predominantly white are also impressive . Food is great . Desserts are even better . Pizza is good . Alfredo Pasta was not at all up to the mark . Quantity is less and price is slightly on the higher side . Overall a decent place .",
