The Chicken Biryani lacked flavor, was excessively oily, and featured less-than-fresh chicken. Despite battling nausea, I tried the Porotta, which, while below average, fared better than the other dishes.\n\nDespite a clean wash area, the prevalence of negative Google reviews proved accurate. With a bill of 972 rupees for three unsatisfactory dishes, the cost did not align with the low-quality experience. Regrettably, I won't be returning or recommending Erode Amman Mess to others.",

Ordered Kochi rasam, which was really good for the cold i had. Butter garlic prawns was ordered as starter with some other chicken items, which was really not that great(felt lil yucky - personal opinion). Mutton biriyani was really good(was served piping hot). Erode roti was not that great. Wheat parotta was good, with paneer butter masala(nice). Egg dosas were really good. Kalakki was Superb. Restaurant service was really good, with everyone tending to our orders really fast. Couldn\u2019t get Elaneer payasam, as it got over.\n\nNow the bad part. I had parked the car by myself with security helping with instructions in-front of the building in the corner. When I was about to get into the car after dinner, he started to ask for tips very rudely. I got irritated and moved the car towards the front of the restaurant for others to enter the car. So I had to wait like 5 mins. He came near the passenger door and was looking at us the entire time, and was telling something bad about tips to another person. People give tips by themselves for wallet parking or good service without asking. But this was like very unpleasant. Restaurant management should look into this.",

After many calls and finally getting someone to talk to us they confirmed our booking.

After that no confirmation.\n\nOne day before we were due to arrive we tried calling the hotel many times and the one time they picked up they said the cab wasn't not available. We gave up and decided to book an uber but randomly got a call from the driver when we arrived at the airport. Why couldn't they have confirmed the booking and given us the driver details? What if we missed the call or weren't able to get in touch? The hotel front desk number doesn't work anyway.\n\nAll this effort, we thought at least the hotel will be good... But we were left disappointed there as well. The AC wasn't working from morning till afternoon anywhere, be it the rooms, the lobby or the cafe. And there was mold and leakage in the rooms. The breakfast was not at all good and they could neither Indian nor continental food right. Luckily our stay was only for a day. I hope this hotel shuts down soon as there is no point of it.",

Food quality can be improved, the one with we ate felt like Marriage food. Ice cream was simple vanilla with no options. Management can increase the price but give great quality food because the place is great and people would love to come here for food.\n3. Buffet menu can be made better and with more options. I felt too much oil in cauliflower (could be just me but I felt it)\n\nIs not all bad, place is great for photo lovers and there a small park for kids but be careful during night time as there are lot of plants and there can be insects or anything.\n\nOverall, nice ambience and with slight quality improvement in food it can become a great hanging out place.\n\nAny questions please free free to ask.\n\nThanks!",

So people who stay here can play outdoor games only in early morning. There are plants and trees all around. Other than the swimming pool and a lawn nothing else is there to qualify this as resort because the resort is very very small in area where you could reach the end of resort from enterance within 3 minutes on foot. Huge parkimg area.  Clean and comfortable rooms with all features. Wonderful luxury rooms. But no innovative features matching vgp. Ideal TTDC etc. In VGP there is a open shower, open bath tub with very large rooms for slightly lesser price. In the morning if you wake up and open the window it is like we are in a hill station with all green trees and sea breeze as per its name Green Meadows . Very pleasant and refreshing moments in all 21 hours we stay. Food price is a scam and we do not know the exact price until we are billed with service charges and taxes. But the food is good except shawarma. 5 star service by people at hotel whether its room delivery or having food at hotel. I felt at home having food here. Food here is nothing Ketala and not even Indian as I could not understand the food by its name in menu card at hotel. Me being a pure veg did not have food here aftet seeing the all non veg items but my family cherished food as they are non vegetarians. The complimentary break fast is too good. The resort rate is higher than VGP with limited area and without innovative facility when compated to VGP but having good rating than VGP is because of the services of Alena and her team. I had a very very memorable time here but having seen large resorts with same price for this very very small resort, I still wonder the price",

                        "text": "It is a small resort. It has a clean swimming pool, large grass lawn and both are occupied by the people of events that are coducted here. So people who stay here can play outdoor games only in early morning. There are plants and trees all around. Other than the swimming pool and a lawn nothing else is there to qualify this as resort because the resort is very very small in area where you could reach the end of resort from enterance within 3 minutes on foot. Huge parkimg area.  Clean and comfortable rooms with all features. Wonderful luxury rooms. But no innovative features matching vgp. Ideal TTDC etc. In VGP there is a open shower, open bath tub with very large rooms for slightly lesser price. In the morning if you wake up and open the window it is like we are in a hill station with all green trees and sea breeze as per its name Green Meadows . Very pleasant and refreshing moments in all 21 hours we stay. Food price is a scam and we do not know the exact price until we are billed with service charges and taxes. But the food is good except shawarma. 5 star service by people at hotel whether its room delivery or having food at hotel. I felt at home having food here. Food here is nothing Ketala and not even Indian as I could not understand the food by its name in menu card at hotel. Me being a pure veg did not have food here aftet seeing the all non veg items but my family cherished food as they are non vegetarians. The complimentary break fast is too good.

The Honey Coriander Chicken and Barbeque Chicken Wings were tender and savory, perfect for any chicken lover. The Swiss Hot Chocolate was rich and comforting, complemented perfectly by the decadent Chocolate Donut and the heavenly Death by Chocolate dessert. The ambiance was cozy, and the service was impeccable. Highly recommend this spot for a delightful culinary experience.",
